maintaining to-do lists and task trackers. Allows you to easily and quickly
organize your time without worrying about the possibility to forget to do
something necessary. With this application, the user does not have to
remember all the many routine cases, and to provide this task to the
program, which in a convenient form organizes and optimizes your schedule.
The program will allow you to get rid of many calendars and planners,
    thereby collecting all the necessary functions in one application.
